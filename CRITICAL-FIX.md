# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX - MathJax require() Error

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE FOUND!**

The `require is not defined` error was caused by a hidden import in `index.tsx`:

```typescript
import 'mathjax'; // ← THIS WAS THE CULPRIT!
```

This line was forcing Vite to try to bundle the npm MathJax package, which contains Node.js code that can't run in browsers.

## ✅ **SOLUTION APPLIED:**

1. **Removed the problematic import** from `index.tsx`
2. **MathJax is now loaded purely via CDN** in the `LatexRenderer` component

## 🚀 **REQUIRED STEPS TO COMPLETE FIX:**

Run these commands to clear the cache and test:

```bash
# 1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)

# 2. Clear Vite cache
rm -rf node_modules/.vite

# 3. Clear npm cache (optional but recommended)
npm cache clean --force

# 4. Reinstall dependencies to remove MathJax completely
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# 5. Start dev server
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**

- ✅ No more "require is not defined" errors
- ✅ MathJax loads cleanly from CDN
- ✅ Mathematical formulas render properly
- ✅ Console shows "MathJax loaded successfully from CDN"

## 📝 **What Changed:**

- **index.tsx**: Removed `import 'mathjax';` 
- **LatexRenderer.tsx**: Now handles all MathJax loading via CDN
- **package.json**: MathJax package removed from dependencies

The application should now run completely error-free! 🏗️✨
